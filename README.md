# TopGyms-App
This is my featured app, TopGym. It's a comprehensive gym-finding application that allows you to discover the closest and best gyms tailored to your preferences. You can save your favorite gyms and easily navigate to them using the built-in route planner.

TopGym is built using SwiftUI and incorporates various technologies such as Core Data, Map Kit, MVVM architecture, Async/Await, API Calls, and Google Places API to fetch data about nearby gyms.

The app consists of four main screens. The first screen displays a map showing gyms within a radius of 3000 meters. You can adjust this radius using a convenient picker. On this screen, you have two viewing options: a map with gym icons or a list view displaying the same gyms. You can switch between these options by tapping the button in the top right corner.

When you select a specific gym, it opens the detailed view. Here, you can explore additional photos, ratings, reviews, and detailed information about the gym. You also have the option to save the gym to your personal list of favorites. Additionally, you can access the directions feature, which displays the optimal route from your current location to the selected gym.

In the saved view, you can review all the gyms you've saved. Similar to the detailed view, you can access information about each gym, including photos, ratings, reviews, and details. If you wish to remove a gym from your saved list, simply tap the designated button.

TopGym offers a seamless and user-friendly experience, empowering you to discover and navigate to the best gyms effortlessly.
